## Library ----
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)

## Loading the data ----
grazing <- read.csv("Data/full_data.csv", header = T)

str(grazing)   # site and plot are integers
summary(grazing)

### Data manipulation ----
grazing <- grazing %>% 
              mutate(site = as.character(site),
                     plot = as.factor(plot))
str(grazing)

ggqqplot(b$richness)
shapiro.test(b$richness)   # p < 0.05 = not normal 

# but will never be normal with this type of data = could just use t-test still 
  # is recommended by people on stack overflow at least (to stick with t-test)

# using a Wilcoxon test 
wilcox.test(richness ~ grazing, data = grazing)   # get a warning
  # p = 0.0045, W = 508
